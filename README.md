# challenge-1

## Description
I have been tasked by marketing company Horiseon to refactor a page from their website to improve accessability and optimise for search engines.

To achieve this I have made necessary changes to meet the below User Story and Accepted Criteria.

Comments have been added to the respective HTML and CSS files, indicating what changes have been made and why.

### User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
### Acceptance Criteria
Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
